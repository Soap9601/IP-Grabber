# IP-Grabber


An IP grabber, also known as an IP logger or IP tracker, is a tool or service used to obtain the IP address of a user without their consent or knowledge. This can be done through various means, including embedding a tracking code in a website, sending a link to the user that triggers the logging mechanism when clicked, or through other deceptive methods.
